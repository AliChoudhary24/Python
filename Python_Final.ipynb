    "\n",
    "Below is a table of information on government grants provided to charitable/community organizations from British Columbia lottery funding. You are going to build on the CommunityGrant data definition (given below) that is appropriate to store one row of information from this table in order to create a data type that can store an arbitrary number of community grants. **Design a data definition to represent an arbitrary number of community grants.** Remember to follow the HtDD recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the CommunityGrant type is based on the information about gaming grants in BC between April 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020.\n",

    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|Abbotsford | Abbotsford Agrifair |\tCommunity Gaming Grant | Arts and Culture | Fair - Agriculture\t| 80000|\n",
    "|Abbotsford | Abbotsford Soccer Association|\tCommunity Gaming Grant | Sport | Soccer | 100000|\n",
    "|Abbotsford | Abbotsford Falcons Football Association |\tCommunity Gaming Grant | Sport | Football, Rugby | 27000|\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design a function that takes a list of community grants and finds the name of the sector (e.g. \"Sport\", or \"Arts and Culture\") that received the largest grant. If two or more are tied, return the first one.** Remember to follow the HtDF recipe and to design helper functions when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "1. You may assume that the input list is not empty. (In that case, be sure to *state* that assumption in your function's purpose! Otherwise callers of your function may think they can pass in an empty list.)\n",
    "2. You may want to design your loop to find the *whole* grant with the largest dollar value. Once you've done that, is there a way to get just the sector's name after the loop?"
